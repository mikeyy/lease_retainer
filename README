The purpose of this script is to ensure an expiring lease retains it's current
IP address. This is achieved by acquiring the expiring lease date and MAC
address for the NIC. A timer is then created for executing the necessary
commands to set the MAC address of the NIC to match the momentarily expiring
NIC. The previous MAC address is reacquired once the lease has expired, and a
new timer is created according to the new expiring lease date.

Includes a remote web panel for management between multiple clients.
